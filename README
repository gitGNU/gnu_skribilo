Skribilo
========

Skribilo is a document authoring system allowing users to produce
documents in a variety of formats (HTML, PostScript, PDF, XML, etc.)
from a single source document, while still retaining fine-grain control
over the output.

Beside rudimentary features provided by the `base' package, Skribilo
provides packages for the production of colored program source code,
bibliographies, pie charts, mathematical equations, and more.

Skribilo is based on the Scheme programming language and is highly
extensible: it is easy to define new documentation primitives (called
"markups") and their rendering in each output format.

Skribilo's core is written in mostly-portable Scheme (i.e., uses
standard APIs such as SRFIs rather than Guile-specific APIs whenever
that is possible), making it intelligible and hackable for most Scheme
programmers.

History
.......

Skribilo is based on the Skribe code base, written by Manuel Serrano and
Erick Gallesio.  See `README.Skribe' for the original Skribe `README'
file, or visit:

I am thankful to them for implementing Skribe!
